# Tasks to Align with the README

- **Replace the demo bootstrap with persistent world loading.** The README promises a persistent hex world with parity between player and NPC factions, yet `SurvivalTruckApp` still seeds itself with `_create_demo_config` and a hard-coded truck. Build a loader that consumes `WorldConfig`/`WorldSnapshot` data so the map, site state, truck, and faction components originate from generated or saved worlds instead of placeholders. 【F:README.md†L91-L155】【F:game/ui/app.py†L120-L218】【F:game/world/save_models.py†L1-L120】
- **Wire the SQLModel/msgpack persistence layer into the turn loop.** Persistence helpers exist but no runtime path writes world configs, daily diffs, or seasonal snapshots. Integrate the functions in `game/world/persistence.py` with the turn engine so saves/loads deliver the SQLite + msgpack flow described in the documentation. 【F:README.md†L127-L149】【F:game/world/persistence.py†L1-L210】【F:game/engine/turn_engine.py†L184-L347】
- **Surface weather and travel telemetry in the UI.** The turn engine already records daily weather modifiers and travel cost reports, yet the dashboard only displays day/season summaries. Present the current weather, modifiers, and recent travel costs so players see the environmental pressure outlined in the gameplay section. 【F:README.md†L171-L183】【F:game/engine/turn_engine.py†L210-L347】【F:game/ui/dashboard.py†L1-L96】
