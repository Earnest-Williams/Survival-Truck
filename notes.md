# Tasks to Align with the README

- **Implement typed world generation and persistence.** Extend the procedural hex-world tooling to spawn the site archetypes listed in the README (cities, farms, power plants, camps, ruins), persist them, and expose their connectivity data. That likely means adding a `type` field to `Site`, generating those records during world creation, and plumbing them into the SQLite/msgpack layer alongside the existing chunk noise helpers. 【F:README.md†L18-L64】【F:game/world/sites.py†L35-L118】【F:game/world/map/__init__.py†L69-L167】
- **Model attention curves with the Gaussian yield profile.** Replace the current linear base/growth/decay parameters with the `peak/mu/sigma` curve described in the design so scavenging risk/reward follows the intended arc. Update persistence and any resource resolution that depends on `AttentionCurve`. 【F:README.md†L100-L106】【F:game/world/sites.py†L11-L155】
- **Introduce weather alongside seasons in the daily loop.** Add a weather model that feeds into travel cost and breakdown risk so turns reflect both seasonal modifiers and dynamic storms or hazards. Hook this into the turn engine and world state. 【F:README.md†L22†L110-L112】【F:game/time/season_tracker.py†L9-L80】
- **Give crew members trait data and lifecycle events.** Expand `CrewMember` to store persistent traits/perks and implement recruitment and loss flows so the crew model matches the README expectations. 【F:README.md†L24】【F:game/crew/__init__.py†L66-L198】
- **Adopt `transitions` state machines for faction behaviour.** Layer a formal FSM over the faction AI (and any other control flows) so NPC factions move between patrol, trade, raid, and alliance states using the library called out in the tech stack. 【F:README.md†L42†L70†L115-L117】【F:game/factions/ai.py†L1-L200】
- **Expose diplomacy information in the TUI.** Add a dedicated Diplomacy panel/screen to the Textual layout so the interface matches the Map/Log/Status/Truck/Diplomacy arrangement promised in the README. 【F:README.md†L81-L83】【F:game/ui/app.py†L49-L150】
- **Add project packaging via Poetry or uv.** Ship a `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent) that declares the dependencies listed in the README and provides an install/run entry point; the repository root currently lacks any packaging metadata. 【F:README.md†L50†L171-L193】【d63ed5†L1-L3】
